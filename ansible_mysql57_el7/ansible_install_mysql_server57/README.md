## Ansible Install MySQL Software and Configure Databases

The Playbook will install MySQL Software and configure databases. You can run Playbook over and over again without an image restore or recreate your VMs. CAUTION, it has logic to remove all existing database data files in data directory. Review the all.yml file and update to your environment.


Procedure to run Playbook:

    Add your private key to your SSH Agent
    $ eval `ssh-agent -s`; ssh-add ~/aws_ec2_private_key.pem

    Note: If you are using Windows, you can use puttygen and pagent.

    To test connection to your VMs
    $ ansible all -m ping -i 18.144.42.55,18.144.42.56


    Run Ansible Playbook
    $ ansible-playbook -i hosts mysql_1linux_common.yml
    $ ansible-playbook -i hosts mysql_2mysql_install_software.yml

    Or, run all at the same time
    $ ansible-playbook -i hosts mysql_run_all.yml


    If you are getting "WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED" message,
    you can use the following command to remove keys in the known_hosts file.
    $ ssh-keygen -R <ip_address_or_hostname>
